    <h1>Agile Basics by Rockopera</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Hi! Welcome to my take on the basics of Agility! I'm rockopera.eth, and this project is a collection of how I think about, and teach in highly modular chunks, Agile-related topics. The style behind each version of a topic is inspired by how much time I have to speak:
    <ul>
      <li>2 seconds : simple words for a 5-year-old</li>
      <li>6 seconds : corporate words for a 50-year-old</li>
      <li>20 seconds : real words for a 500-year-old team</li>
      <li>60 seconds : my tale for a 500-year-old tribe</li>
    </ul>
