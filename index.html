    <h1>Agile Basics by Rockopera</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Hi! Welcome to my opinion on the basics of Agility! I'm rockopera.eth, and this project is a collection of how I think about, and teach in highly modular pieces, Agile-related topics. The style behind each version of a topic is inspired by how much time I have to speak, which I will explain by way of demonstrating as if I only have 2 seconds to speak:
    <ul>
      <li>2 seconds : easy words for a 5-year-old</li>
      <li>6 seconds : businessy words for a 50-year-old</li>
      <li>20 seconds : normal words for a 500-year-old team</li>
      <li>60 seconds : a story for a 5000-year-old tribe</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Agility in 2 seconds</h2>
    2s @ 6s : Imagine a pre-schooler looking up at you, so honor their life experience, vocabulary, and attention span.<BR>
    Agile @ 2s : a <u>style</u> for how to solve problems<BR>
    Scrum @ 2s : a <u>game</u> for solving problems<BR>
    Product Owner @ 2s : <u>picks</u> which problems to solve<BR>
    Development Team @ 2s : <u>makes</u> stuff to solve problems<BR>
    Scrum Master @ 2s : <u>helps</u> people play the Scrum game better<BR>
    Sprint Backlog @ 2s : a <u>list</u> of problems to solve now<BR>
    Product Backlog @ 2s : a <u>list</u> of problems to solve later<BR>
    Work Increment @ 2s : the <u>stuff</u> we hope solves a problem<BR>
    Sprint @ 2s : a <u>turn</u> in the Scrum game<BR>
    Kanban @ 2s : some <u>rules</u> for doing stuff<BR>
    Sprint Planning @ 2s : to <u>pick</u> problems to solve next<BR>
    Daily Scrum @ 2s : to check if anyone is <u>stuck</u><BR>
    Refining @ 2s : to get <u>ready</u> problems to solve next<BR>
    Sprint Review @ 2s : to <u>learn</u> from what problems we solved<BR>
    Sprint Retrospective @ 2s : to <u>learn</u> from how we solved problems<BR>
    2s @ 20s : Look. You want a more Agile world? What better way than to break it into what we teach kids. But make it not boring for them. Convey the essence in a way they will understand, which may be oversimplifying for us adults, but is appropriate for their more play-based default mode.
    
    <h2>Agility in 6 seconds</h2>
    6s @ 6s : Definitional, and packed with higher-level ideas, to unpack over coffee with a fellow adult.<BR>
    Agile @ 6s : a <u>mindset</u> for making BIG things... by trying SMALL things and learning from BOTH... the customers and the makers<BR>
    Scrum @ 6s : a <u>framework</u> for making BIG things... by trying SMALL things and learning from BOTH... the customers and the makers<BR>
    Product Owner @ 6s : <u>empathizes</u> with ALL parties... then <u>prioritizes</u> what to TRY now and next... towards an INSPIRING vision<BR>
    Development Team @ 6s: <u>SOLVES</u> problems... or <u>LEARNS</u> about them... by <u>TRYING</u> small things autonomously... and at a sustainable pace<BR>
    Scrum Master @ 6s : <u>coaches</u> INTENTIONAL evolution... through continuous improvement at ALL levels... and at a sustainable pace<BR>
    Kanban @ 6s : an <u>approach</u> that values doing a FEW things at a time... and continuously improving the FLOW of VISUALIZED work<BR>
    Work Increment @ 6s : the <u>FRUITS</u> of labor by a FOCUSED team, READY <u>for FEEDBACK</u> from all parties, while DONE enough <u>to SHIP</u><BR>
    Sprint Backlog @ 6s : a SHORT and STATIC <u>list... of HIGHEST priority</u> stuff... that's READY enough to start<BR>
    Product Backlog @ 6s : a LONG and CHANGING <u>list... of LOWER priority</u> stuff... that's sourced FROM FEEDBACK<BR>
    Sprint @ 6s : the UNCHANGING <u>TIME BOX</u> for the Scrum framework... with SCHEDULED opportunities for PLANNING and REVIEWING<BR>
    Sprint Planning @ 6s : to <u>FORECAST</u> what to do and achieve... by the END of the UPCOMING Sprint... that's <u>NEXT HIGHEST PRIORITY</u><BR>
    Daily Sprint @ 6s : to <u>REFORECAST</u> what to do and achieve... by the END of the CURRENT Sprint... and <u>ASK for HELP</u> face-to-face<BR>
    Refining @ 6s : to <u>DISCUSS</u> as a TEAM the <u>NEXT highest priority</u> things to do... until they are READY enough to START<BR>
    Sprint Review @ 6s : to get <u>FEEDBACK</u> from <u>CUSTOMERS</u> on <u>WHAT</u> was done in the Sprint... and how it fits in the context of longer-term plans<BR>
    Sprint Retrospective @ 6s : to get <u>FEEDBACK</u> from the DEVELOPMENT <u>TEAM</u> on <u>HOW</u> they did in the Sprint... and then they decide what to try to be better.<BR>
    6s @ 20s : Assume an audience who has experienced corporate terms, and now balance the capturing of core ideas with it not feeling like simply listing buzzwords. Aim for density that inspires curiosity, but let's be real: likely a request for it to be said again, and slower this time.

    <h2>Agility in 20 seconds</h2>
    20s @ 6s : The utility and opinion I really want to say, to help a team last as long as the oldest corporations.<BR>
    Agile @ 20s : It's a way of acting in the world where you embrace feedback, not just on what you're doing, by talking to customers, but also how you're doing it, by talking to the makers, and if you're so bold, why you're doing it at all, by talking to the leaders. And if you want better feedback, learn more often by doing less at a time.<BR>
    Scrum @ 20s : It's a collection of ideas, from a study of successful projects, on how to build things and solve problems as a team, in an environment that's always changing. The roles and gatherings are defined to manage risk by making smaller things, then learning from both the impact of those things, and how they were made.<BR>
    Product Owner @ 20s : Set a vision. Inspire people with said vision. Set a prioritization scheme towards that vision. Now prepare to disappoint people as you get ideas from customers and stakeholders because you have to be able to say "no" and "not yet", explaining the prioritization scheme, and priorities, that serve the vision.<BR>
    Development Team @ 20s : This small and cross-functional team is the unit of productivity, a set of makers whose expertise is respected when crafting both how they work together, and the work itself. They aim to turn a concept into cash, empowered to offer a change unto the world as a nudge towards the team's and customer's desired futures.<BR>
    20s @ 20s : Picture an appeal, in my most personal words, before a team embarking on a quest to survive for generations, and evolve through a future we cannot foresee. Not intending breadth, this final parting shot has depth from experience, or nuance from practice. And then the spaceship doors seal shut, so make it count.
